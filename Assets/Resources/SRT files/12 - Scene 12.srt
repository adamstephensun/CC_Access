1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,503
- But what's that gonna mean?

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,440
- If you let yourself,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,650
you can really imagine what the decisions

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,123
you made could mean.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,123
The path you've lit forward.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,670
I think that in knowing in the early days,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,283
they will rely on us for everything,

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,580
it can drive a fear that
can drive you to want

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,103
to protect them from whatever you can.

10
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:40,560
But when I cast my mind

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,833
into the future of this
life I have created,

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,173
all I hope is that it is
a life lived joyously,

13
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:52,443
freely, fulfilled.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,503
I think if I had a wish for them,

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,930
it would be that it
would have the security

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,033
to be who they wanted to be,

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,403
to find a purpose that brings
them more happiness than pain.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,523
Because, well,

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,903
because isn't that the best
we can hope for in life?

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,630
And I can't see why that's
not achievable for most,

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,223
if not all children.

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,390
And I suspect that it's less

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,470
about choosing the children
that come into the world

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,660
than choosing a better
world for these children

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,493
to come into.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,010
For our problem is and always has been

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,903
how we ensure that
better world comes about.
