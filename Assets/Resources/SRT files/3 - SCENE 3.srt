1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,440
- I don't know if I expected more of you

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,740
would have consider using this technology

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,233
to genetically alter your child.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,300
- Changing the genetic destiny

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,403
of living beings is nothing new,

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,780
because even before we
knew the world to be round,

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,540
humanity has known
something of the cultivation

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,853
of life's genetic codes.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,420
Through our interventions,

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,420
we turned small wild horses
into huge, strong thoroughbreds,

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,080
wolves into Great Danes and sausage dogs,

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,970
and domesticated most of the cereals

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,843
and plant-based foods that
adorn people's plates today.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,580
For millennia, a system of
trial and error was our only way

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,120
to shape life to fit our purpose.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,780
But with our new genetic
engineering technology,

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,540
we can pinpoint the smallest

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,270
of genetic changes we want to make

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,663
and change the course
of life's development.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,940
- Giving us the power
to not only create life

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,933
but to control it,

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,310
making us the gods of
ours, and others, destiny.

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,790
- Yes, in a way.

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,530
Using these technologies

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,440
and the maps of life we have created,

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,790
we have genetically engineered
drought-resistant plants,

27
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,300
fluorescent mice, and
self-destructive mosquitoes.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,920
And, when it comes to us,

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,480
it has pushed our ability

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,180
to change the next generations of humanity

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,570
in ways we could almost of never imagined.

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,570
- And that always starts
with genetic screening?

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,720
- Yes, in order to enact any alterations,

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,223
the unborn child would need
to undergo genetic screening.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,000
These tell us more than the sex

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,060
and apparent visual health of a child,

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,720
they can tell us intimate
details about their health,

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,443
development potential, and life chances.

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,300
- And some might say it reveals too much.

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,350
- Do they?

41
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,140
- Would you want somebody
to know all about you,

42
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,820
your history, your potential?

43
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,840
- This is not about me.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,390
- Because these scans lay bare everything

45
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,710
that was once a journey
of discovery and surprise.

46
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,430
We'd be told the likely colour
of their hair, their eyes,

47
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,810
the shape of their ears,

48
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,390
even the likely amount
of sleep they'll need.

49
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,840
- Just because we perform such a scan,

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
it does not mean the parents

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,520
would have to use all
the information we have.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,400
- That may be, but we'd know it,

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,340
and we have to acknowledge
there's always an inherent danger

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,050
in where knowledge like that can take us.

55
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,710
- Well, think of the
advantages of scans like these.

56
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,550
Most of the time,

57
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,150
they will reveal nothing
of major importance,

58
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,250
but think of all those diseases

59
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,260
that can hide within our genes

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,340
that we could catch and
prevent at an early stage.

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,620
- If only it would be that simple.

62
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,160
Because often we aren't
talking about absolutes,

63
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,560
we're talking about percentages,

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,310
a statistic on the chance
of something happening,

65
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,813
and we'd be basing all future
decisions on that percentage.

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,870
- In some ways,

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,683
I struggle to imagine
what this child would be.

68
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:38,853
In others, I see them as clear as day.

69
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,070
I know what I receive on a
bit of paper will not be then,

70
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,980
but I cannot help but wonder

71
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,210
what effects knowing
more about them may do

72
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,853
to how I treat them,

73
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,253
how I see them.

74
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,373
- At this stage, it is just a scan.

75
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,973
What would you have to
lose from taking it?

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,660
- This is almost a redundant question

77
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,870
for those of you that have already said

78
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,010
you would consider genetically
engineering your child,

79
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,873
as this is a precursor for that.

80
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,253
But, but let us start afresh.

81
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,730
Would you like to know
as much as you could

82
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,263
about your unborn child by
using genetic screening,

83
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,173
or would you still like
that natural mysticism?
