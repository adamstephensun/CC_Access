1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,433
- That is a lot to comprehend isn't it?

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,920
- May I ask, seeing as
we can do all of this,

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,780
would we be able to
change their eye colour?

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,880
- Makes sense that someone would go there.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,790
- Well it's just that my granddad

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,160
had green eyes and none
of our kids have it.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,010
Be really nice to carry that on, you know?

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,290
- They're polygenic traits.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,353
So they're more complicated
than you'd imagine.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,230
- But you could attempt to change a number

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,380
of attributes like hair colour and height.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,270
If you really wanted to.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,890
- Are we sure this is wise
power to give parents?

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,310
Look at the stupid names
people give to their kids.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,430
- Yeah, I mean when I was
pregnant I couldn't even

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,380
decide what socks to
put on in the morning.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,103
So I'd hate to think what
choices I would've made.

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,520
- I don't see this sort of editing

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,070
being something many people would want.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,350
- You've heard of cosmetic surgery, right?

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,550
- Yes, but what -

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,100
- That's not short of takers is it?

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,350
And just think, that
went from reconstructive

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,460
plastic surgery to pec,
breast and butt implants

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,460
or whatever it is that's fashionable now.

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,200
- I can't see anything wrong with that.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,620
- How about the effects of
a fashion for lighter skin?

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,590
Or slender bodies or western eyes?

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,760
- That's not a thing.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,100
- I think you'll find it is.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,250
And isn't it a bit weird the parents

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,830
choosing how the child looks?

33
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,720
- So we can change their eye colour?

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,910
- If I were you, I'd
concentrate on changing

35
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,250
their intelligence more
than their eye colour.

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,360
- What are you trying to say?

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,770
- I'm just saying that if we're

38
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,450
to use this technology properly

39
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,730
then we should concentrate more

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,970
on those things that
create the greatest impact.

41
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,350
Like intelligence, athletic
ability if you will.

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,180
- Isn't that going a bit too far though?

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,580
- And changing their eye colour isn't?

44
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,020
- No, it's...

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,580
No, it's just...

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,960
- Well imagine I edit my
children to become the smartest

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,810
most intelligent that
technology could allow.

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,910
Where might this leave your children?

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,180
- I'd make my kids the the
smartest they could be.

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,510
- Intelligence isn't just
one particular thing.

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,250
You do know that, right?

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,360
- Yes, of course.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,700
But if I give to my children the relevant

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,360
genetic talents to make
the most of this world,

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,850
then they will have had
the basis of all the things

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,270
they need to achieve
success and happiness.

57
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,450
- You say that as if environment
has nothing to do with it.

58
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,710
- Of course it does.

59
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,960
But what if they do it, and them,

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,080
and both your neighbours
and your best friend?

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,710
Imagine how it'd feel to
have your child fall behind

62
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,773
because you choose not to
help them and others did.

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,940
- I take back what I
said about eye colour.

64
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,000
It's just sometimes you
can go a bit too far.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
- It would be about money anyway.

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,930
- But that's wrong, isn't it?

67
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,800
- Once a technology exists,
there's no stopping it.

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,363
You just have to embrace it.

69
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,180
- But why can't you stop it?

70
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,470
- Because it would never work.

71
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,370
- Why?

72
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,633
- Because it wouldn't.

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,530
- Would you really like to see

74
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,080
edits of this nature stopped?

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,101
- Yeah, yeah, I think I would.

76
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,630
I just think that there's got to be

77
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,769
a line that we shouldn't cross.

78
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:24,903
Right?

79
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,423
- What about you?

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,490
I mean this is interesting.

81
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,330
Because we aren't talking
about a change to stop

82
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,810
something potentially
restricting their life.

83
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,060
We're talking about an enhancement

84
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,063
beyond what it was destined to be.

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,583
And enhancements like
this are complex, right?

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,920
Your view of aesthetics or intelligence.

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,263
Is maybe different to what it is to me.

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,263
A lesson too.

89
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,000
I may value speed, you endurance.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,680
But there is a causality to the answers.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,080
For if your child is edited,

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,453
and the rest of us choose not to.

93
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,803
Then.

94
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,630
- But in the end don't we
all just want the same thing?

95
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,813
To make our children's
lives the best they can be?

96
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,810
And if we can achieve that
through this technology

97
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,023
then why wouldn't we want to do it?

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
- I see that...

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,850
I think there's a real possibility

100
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,683
for this technology to do some good.

101
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,633
It could make people's lives better.

102
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,110
But I think a lot of things.

103
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,843
Could have made my son's life better.

104
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,710
And none of them are answered

105
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,103
in the question of changing who he was.

106
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:11,760
- None?

107
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,593
- None.

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,873
- None.

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,910
- Well I'm definitely
gonna be enhancing my kids.

110
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,133
- And I guess there lies our problem.

111
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,623
- Would you enhance your child?
