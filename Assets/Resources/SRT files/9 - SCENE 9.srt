1
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:08,493
- And if this is not
beyond what I can ask,

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,263
do you think people should
have the right to do this?

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,320
- I think when answering this question,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,850
you have to think seriously

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,250
about what it says about our society

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,490
if we're willing to take
away the rights of a parent

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,157
to have a child like themselves.

8
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:38,460
- I understand.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,970
If you think people should have this right

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,840
to give their child what in some society

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,833
may consider an impairment,
please answer Yes now.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,310
If you think people
shouldn't have the right

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,963
to choose a deaf child, for
instance, choose No now.
