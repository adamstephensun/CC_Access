1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,940
- We should also consider

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,420
that some of the worst
diseases known to us,

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,980
sickle cell, Huntington's
Disease, cystic fibrosis,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,990
could all be scanned for.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,810
And if you found your
child had one of these,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,963
they'll all but be guaranteed
to suffer as a result.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,100
But with this technology,

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,533
you could try to prevent it.

9
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,675
So, there can be some certainty?

10
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:34,008
- In some cases.

11
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,448
If your child was to
have a form of disease

12
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,998
or genetic disorder like the ones mention

13
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,372
that carried a level of certainty,

14
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,981
would you choose to use
this technology then,

15
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,672
to alter your child?
