1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,473
- Will this one survive?

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,470
- It's probably too early to tell.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,648
- But there is hope.

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,481
- There's always hope.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,210
- This technology has the potential

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,313
to bring hope to millions.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,060
With its power, we can make interventions

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,673
in ways we previously only dreamt of.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,350
Because the process of screening
and editing our children

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,810
not only allows us to hunt down reasons

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,303
that cause a life to end too soon,

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,490
it can help us to find and
prevent the genetic diseases

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,243
and abnormalities that will
affect their later life.

14
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,690
For example, there is a particular gene

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,800
that if it is carried by the
parent and passed to the child,

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,100
that child will have an
extraordinarily high chance

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,890
of developing breast cancer.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,300
- Very few of us carry those genes

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
- Still.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,270
Could you imagine just for a minute,

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,160
sitting with your child,

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,503
suffering through
procedure after procedure

23
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,300
with a disease caused

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,990
by the genetic material you gave to them

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,173
that you choose to do nothing about?

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,910
- I would assume, in most of these cases,

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,990
an intervention could be made
later in their development.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,890
- What do you mean by that?

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,270
- Well, if I'm right,

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,040
in this example,

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,703
we are talking about
altered versions of BRCA1,

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,853
although it could be various others.

33
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,280
Variants of these genes
can increase the risk

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,603
of getting breast cancer,

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,240
but there are options one can
take once a child is born.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,900
- That may be, but why take the risk?

37
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,790
Surely, it's better to
ensure they cannot happen

38
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,290
in the first place.

39
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,083
- Well, from a medical perspective,

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,510
I can certainly see the benefits
of using genetic editing

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,600
to eliminate serious congenital diseases

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,580
or high-risk mutations before
a foetus reaches full term.

43
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,580
But, these conditions that
we talk of can vary hugely

44
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,460
in terms of the effects
on a person's life,

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,243
their presentation, and
severity of symptoms.

46
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,550
If we cannot accurately predict the impact

47
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,540
of eliminating or changing one's genes,

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,500
then we could not
ethically make the decision

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,510
to make those alterations.

50
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,030
- I think we are overcomplicating this.

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,460
Remember, an intervention of this nature

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,480
stops the potential of
something cruel and painful

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,050
before it even has the
chance to manifest itself.

54
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,490
It will not stop all cancers,

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,910
but imagine for those
parents that carry risk

56
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,340
how freeing it could be to remove it.

57
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,100
- But as I said before, at this stage,

58
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,200
parents would be calculating risk

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,870
and making decisions
on a percentage chance

60
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,460
of something possibly
happening way in the future.

61
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,040
Decisions a child would not have a say in.

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,770
- In these cases,
percentage or no percentage,

63
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,040
surely the impact of our
inaction will have more risk

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,113
than any action we could take.

65
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,153
- No one can dispute cancer is.

66
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,700
And passing a gene hidden
in our own genetic code

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,803
that poses them risk is.

68
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,670
It feels natural to try and protect one

69
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,240
from such illnesses we could pass on them.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,750
But to talk about making a change now

71
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,550
to potentially save their life

72
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,550
in five, 10, 50, 80
years from now is just...

73
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,520
- I'd say it comes down to

74
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,280
if you feel you should
make these decisions

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,540
not fully knowing what
the consequences would be,

76
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,100
or you wait

77
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,444
to make an intervention.
- When it could be too late.

78
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,611
When it could be too late.

79
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,153
- When the level of risk
could be better understood.

80
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,570
- Would you want to remove genes

81
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,223
from your child that might
pose them a risk in the future,

82
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,090
or would you prefer to give them some role

83
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,170
in this decision later in life

84
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,553
if that was possible?
