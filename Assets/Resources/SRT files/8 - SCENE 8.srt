1
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:22,650
- I can see why that may be.

2
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,140
Would you be happy to explain more

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,063
and we can interpret for you?

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,440
Sure, I want my child
to come into the world

5
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,410
full of breath, life, a
healthy baby, Deaf or hearing.

6
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,610
But also, it would be funny to say

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,608
I hadn't thought about
raising a Deaf child.

8
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,933
I would be lying.

9
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,733
I'm Deaf.

10
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,473
I have a beautiful life.

11
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:02,073
As a child growing up
in the 80s, it was hard.

12
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,750
My environment was very hearing,

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,750
family, school, and I just
didn't know how to be me.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,800
In a world that every
day taught me, told me

15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,830
because I wasn't hearing
there was a fault with me.

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,360
That was wrong.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,750
But eventually I found my tribe, friends,

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,990
my culture, the Deaf community.

19
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,600
That's the beauty of my world.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,163
I know that to have and
to raise a Deaf child,

21
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:42,723
they can have that too.

22
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,161
- Surely we can't allow that.

23
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,020
- Why not?

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,973
- Because you'd be making it deaf.

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,070
- And? You're missing the point.

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,080
A child is a child.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,623
A Deaf child can really soar at life.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,893
- This really is madness.

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,770
- You don't understand.

30
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,813
But even that's a bit much.

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,600
- I think it goes without saying

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,370
that I'm for parental choice,

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,910
but it has to be
questioned if it conflicts

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,030
with the right of the
child to an open future.

35
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,750
Put simply, what if the child grows up

36
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,750
and no longer wants to be deaf?

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,583
- I'll tell you what.

38
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,770
The parent would've messed
the child up. That's what.

39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,560
- Harmed, I think is the more
appropriate language here.

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,230
- Harmed? I would never.

41
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,700
- I'm sure you wouldn't mean to,

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,690
but if they grew up not wanting to be deaf

43
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,990
and that was a decision
that you had made for them,

44
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,960
then unfortunately there's
probably no other way

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,030
of describing it.

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,573
- Your response is typical, expected.

47
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,840
Everything up to this point that I said

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,840
about my lived experience,
why I want a Deaf child,

49
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,733
has gone in one ear and out the other.

50
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,253
Perhaps you're just not ready
for this type of conversation.

51
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,033
I understand.

52
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,870
I know that it is not for you,

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,020
but would you be happy for
me to describe deafness

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,343
as an impairment?

55
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,593
Your words.

56
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,050
Would you consider using this technology

57
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,500
to ensure your child had a trait

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,500
that others may consider an
impairment such as deafness?
