1
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:10,470
- This doesn't have to stop there.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,230
Bestowed upon us is a great opportunity

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,960
to ensure no child suffers as a result

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,553
of their genetic makeup.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,060
We could intervene to
ensure no child is born

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,970
with congenital blindness, deafness.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,930
- Hold on.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,920
A lot of deaf people

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,370
wouldn't consider their
impairment a disadvantage.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,353
- Culturally, maybe not.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,320
But if we can make alterations

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,610
before a child is born,
why impair them at all?

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,630
- I suppose you're applying
this to Down syndrome, autism,

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,880
people who are small in stature, right?

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,670
- If it could give them a better life.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,670
- The thing is, there's
no real way to ensure

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,790
any of the changes we make
will make their life better.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,950
The only way to ensure
that is through the actions

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,960
we take in life.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,270
- To believe that would be to believe

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,220
there is no innate benefit

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,670
to being able to hear, see, or walk.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,100
- But those traits are only
beneficial in a society

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,770
which refuses to accommodate difference.

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,810
- I'm not denying that.

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,990
What I'm saying is that
why make it an issue

27
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,430
in the first place?

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,740
Isn't it better to remove all traits

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,430
that might prevent a
child having a great life?

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,780
Would that not be a key to
a fairer, happier society

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,313
than the one we have now?

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,580
- How about better education,

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,060
better healthcare provisions,
nurturing environments?

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,060
- Yes, I agree, but I'm
also saying that morally

35
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,240
and logically, if we can ensure

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,330
that our children can live
unhindered by disability-

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,940
- There will still be disabled people.

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,540
Unless you think you can
eliminate a genetic predisposition

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,220
towards car accidents.

40
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,577
- I'm not denying that
disability will still exist

41
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:04,020
in some form, but it's not like before,

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,460
where if you got a test result

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,880
and it presented you
with a child or situation

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,430
you didn't think you could handle,

45
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,550
Down syndrome, for example, previously,

46
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,273
more often than not, the
only option was abortion.

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,033
But now, we could just change the child.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,493
- I don't even know
how to respond to that.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,763
- If I may?

50
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,783
- Of course, go on.

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,470
- As I've been listening,
I've been asking myself

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
if I had a choice, would
I have chosen my son?

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,470
It feels wrong to even
be considering that.

54
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,843
He's my son, after all.

55
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,133
The way I look at it,
ultimately, is like this.

56
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,993
Yes, he could be difficult sometimes.

57
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,633
Yes, it was exhausting,

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,013
but he wouldn't have been
him without his traits.

59
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,203
Who he is,

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,743
how he thought, what he said.

61
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,323
So yes.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,390
Some days, he drove me nuts

63
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,180
and it felt like I
couldn't stand it anymore,

64
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,180
and that, that was rubbish for us both.

65
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,450
But some days, he could be so
gentle and loving and funny.

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,310
And I remembered that really,
everyone is like that.

67
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,063
Everyone has good days and tricky days.

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,890
Just because I could have chosen a child

69
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,613
that didn't have those genes,

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,040
it doesn't mean that
I would've had a child

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,633
that was any,

72
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,973
however much it may have
made my life easier.

73
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,733
So no,

74
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,993
in the end,

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I don't think it was or should
have been my responsibility

76
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,353
to change my child.

77
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,903
It was just my job to
love him, and I did that.

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,873
But surely, an alteration could
have made their life better?

79
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,613
- You know what?

80
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,536
I don't think it could.

81
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:29,460
- Life is just too complex for alterations

82
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,400
like this alone to make a parent

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,810
or child's life better.

84
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,643
- Really?

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,230
Imagine this then.

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,990
You've got three kids,

87
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,620
and one of them has special needs,

88
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,810
which means that the other two are always

89
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,363
being put last, you know?

90
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,166
Because of the special one, they'd suffer,

91
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:58,166
the kids would suffer and
the parents would suffer too.

92
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,030
Who wants that?

93
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,890
No one benefits.

94
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,890
It's just more time, more
money, and more hard work.

95
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,573
Where's the reward?

96
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,143
Look, I'm not being funny,

97
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:18,963
but some people are
basically just vegetables.

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,063
And then they die.

99
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,580
What sort of life is that
to wish for your kids?

100
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,143
It's better not to live
than to live like that.

101
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,337
Well, I know I'd be bloody miserable

102
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:38,103
if that was my life.

103
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,330
Assuming that is that
I've got the intelligence

104
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,520
to know how shit my life was

105
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,083
and how miserable I am.

106
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,590
It's a quick tweak.

107
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,880
That's all that's needed,

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,070
and then you're saved,

109
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,003
claiming benefits for
the rest of your life.

110
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,273
People might not like this
idea, but it's the truth.

111
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,240
- I'm not sure how helpful
phrasing it that way is,

112
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,613
but there is some truth in it.

113
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,670
Our children have always been subject

114
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,560
to the lottery of genetics.

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Sometimes, it's good, sometimes bad,

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,400
but if we can alter a child's genetic code

117
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,420
before it's born to improve
its chances of a good life,

118
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,390
then surely, in the interest of the child,

119
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,403
we should be obliged to do it.

120
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,260
To refrain from changing
a child's genetics

121
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,060
if we're able to do so,

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,170
especially if not to do so
would lead to them suffering

123
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,283
would be wrong.

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,563
- I'm not sure.

125
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,870
I've been thinking about
would I choose to be disabled?

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,983
I've thought about it a lot, trust me.

127
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,700
Didn't have much else to do some days

128
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,360
than ponder my existence

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,360
and how much better off
people would feel without me.

130
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,903
Sorry, bit grim.

131
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,553
But when you spend your whole life,

132
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,400
literally, your whole life being treated

133
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,663
like you're a burden,

134
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,183
are not always outwardly, but sometimes.

135
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,633
Mostly it's subliminal though.

136
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,550
The look of pity in a stranger's eyes.

137
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,703
The never seeing someone like me on TV.

138
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,863
And it's not just that.

139
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,983
It's not just everyone else's bullshit.

140
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,513
It's the reality of it too.

141
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,483
Sometimes,

142
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,210
I'm in pain

143
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,113
and people don't really understand.

144
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,630
They try really hard.

145
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,623
I know they do,

146
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,230
but you can't understand
unless you live it,

147
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,233
unless you're in pain 24/7.

148
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,193
And sometimes even when
I do everything right,

149
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,383
I still have flare ups
and I can't walk at all.

150
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,170
And I feel so shit for needing
everyone to take care of me.

151
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,160
And I can't even
concentrate on feeling shit

152
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,533
because I'm in so much pain.

153
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,853
That's the worst.

154
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,003
But it's not always like that.

155
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,894
And as much as I'd love
to never have another one

156
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:12,894
of those days, I don't
think I'd rather be dead.

157
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,450
Because that's the thing, isn't it?

158
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,650
It's not like if my
parents had had the scan,

159
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,200
they'd be choosing
between me being disabled

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,153
and me not being disabled.

161
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,283
They'd be choosing between
me and no me at all.

162
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,343
Because changing my disability
means I wouldn't be who I am.

163
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,230
- So like you wouldn't hold
against your mom and dad

164
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,073
if they could have made the
decision and just didn't?

165
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,340
- All I can say is

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,420
as much as I hate myself some days

167
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,133
for the way that I am,

168
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,973
I am who I am.

169
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,740
I wouldn't wanna be anyone else.

170
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,240
- Would you use genetic engineering

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,583
to change your unborn child,

172
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,073
So to remove an impairment,
a disability, if you will,

173
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,703
if one was discovered in your child?
