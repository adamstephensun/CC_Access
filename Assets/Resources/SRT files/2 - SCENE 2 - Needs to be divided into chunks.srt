1
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,856
- We have a problem.

2
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,820
You see, in this time
before memory existed,

3
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,520
out of nothing...

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,520
a universe was created so big, so massive,

5
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,153
it is impossible to comprehend
in any meaningful way.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,200
But in one small corner of
that vast, vast universe,

7
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,333
through pure chance and the
great infiniteness of time,

8
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,920
a proliferation of life emerged,

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,883
life that would eventually become us.

10
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,610
If you think about it,

11
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,400
from the birth of that first star

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
when everything that has ever existed

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,570
or will ever exist emerged, to now,

14
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,570
the probability of us
existing at all is unlikely.

15
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,043
Ridiculous, even.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,860
But here we are.

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,883
Me and you.

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,229
And, that makes us all pretty special

19
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,603
in our own unique way.

20
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,900
For most of our existence,

21
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,545
even if we knew very well the act

22
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:04,560
that led to the development of life,

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,560
we knew little detail of
exactly how we were created.

24
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,700
Yet a mother

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,590
could still feel the
flutter of new life inside,

26
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,590
the changes in ones body,
the growing bump to know

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,653
that the potential of
life existed within them.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,943
And, when this bump grew enough,

29
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:33,543
new life is born.

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,750
Life fraught with the
responsibility of its dependency,

31
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,110
of untold challenges, and reward.

32
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,983
And, oh, how much reward it can bring.

33
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,630
Indescribable joy and an
unspeakable bond that...

34
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:01,713
that... is almost beyond
our simple understanding.

35
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,320
For some, it can be one of
the greatest achievements

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,853
we can ever make.

37
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,110
But from the darkness of this unknown

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,110
both natural curiosity and a
burning desire for knowledge

39
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,187
led us to light..

40
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,920
In the blink of an eye

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,640
we leapt from measuring the size of a bump

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,873
to looking within it.

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Scans revealed life as it exists here,

44
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,190
the cord, the sac, a tiny waving hand,

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,443
the beating of their heart.

46
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,858
We recorded information on each

47
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:58,953
and every little growing life we could.

48
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,703
And then we learnt to do more than look.

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,973
We discovered the code of life itself.

50
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,010
DNA, Deoxyribonucleic acid, they call it.

51
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,890
It's not important to
know exactly what it is,

52
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,153
or to worry about the
coding, non-coding dilemma.

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,100
All you need to know is, it is the code,

54
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,930
born of when your father's
sperm met your mother's egg,

55
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,700
that instructed every gene, every cell,

56
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,790
tissue, skin cell,

57
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,790
every ounce of blood,
every organ to be created,

58
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,853
so you could become you.

59
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,690
Over time, we researched and
explored what DNA could do,

60
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,993
finally laying out the human genome,

61
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,213
the entire set of
instructions of our being,

62
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,053
a genetic map of ourselves.

63
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,040
Through this prism, the
very knowledge of genetics

64
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,040
began to shape how we think and understand

65
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,573
all living beings.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,040
In no time at all, a sample of your hair,

67
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,690
or a swab of your mouth
could reveal your history,

68
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,463
understand your present,
and predict your future.

69
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,840
We know genetics is not
all there is, far from it,

70
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,020
but they are the core,
the building blocks,

71
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,020
the foundation of life that
shape and evolve with us.

72
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,560
Soon enough we learnt to
shape those very foundations,

73
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,893
to control what once we could not.

74
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,070
And, these new abilities
in genetic engineering,

75
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,390
makes every action, every inaction

76
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,713
in the genetic development
of our children a choice.

77
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,490
A power both awesome and terrifying,

78
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,930
the moral dilemmas that
arise from this power

79
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,953
may be the biggest
humanity has ever faced.

80
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,930
That is why today

81
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,880
I need to know what role
genetic engineering will play

82
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,153
in the development of our unborn children.

83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,240
For when the fate of humanity is at sake..

84
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,240
There can be greater
responsibility, no greater urgency,

85
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,003
to the answers we seek.

86
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,980
For us to find the true
answers to these dilemmas,

87
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,740
I need to ask you to place yourself

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,460
in the role of an expectant parent.

89
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,093
Think of this as a test
of your imagination,

90
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,243
a role play, if you like.

91
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,473
So, lets go on this journey together.

92
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,000
Close your eyes if you will

93
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,320
and lets imagine what it is

94
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,173
to be this expectant parent.

95
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,973
Imagine that first
pregnancy test turning blue,

96
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,547
or the confirmation of successful IVF,

97
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,500
the ecstasy of knowing,

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,880
and the trepidation of
having created a new life,

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,740
and the practicality of what that life

100
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:21,123
may mean to your every day.

101
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,140
Imagine yourself in the heyday
of your life or maybe not;

102
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,410
prepared most likely not,

103
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,410
because we never are
but still in a position

104
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,243
to bring new life into this world.

105
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,810
If you really cannot get there,

106
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,840
maybe take the role of a supportive friend

107
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
or family member...

108
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,823
Are we there?

109
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,670
Okay, hold that thought in your mind

110
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,013
and open your eyes, if you will.

111
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,883
Don't lose that thought.

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,343
Keep holding.

113
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,023
Here are your fragile new lives.

114
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,730
Each one an individual,
linked to the decisions you,

115
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,450
and you alone make.

116
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,283
Each one a child to be, a
child cherished and wanted.

117
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,520
Yearned and planned for.

118
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,083
A parent to them you wish...
wish desperately to be.

119
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,480
And, I want to ask if for
this fragile little life,

120
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,920
we are imagining bringing into the world

121
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:49,833
if would you consider changing it?

122
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,310
Changing the genetic makeup

123
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,073
that it was originally destined to have?

124
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,660
For in a time before now,
our ignorance, our inability,

125
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,910
protected us from the questions

126
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,450
of altering our own species...

127
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,450
But not now and not for you
because it is these questions,

128
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
of altering our own species

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,470
that I'm am seeking
answers for from you...

130
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,940
So, I wonder, from the
little I have explained

131
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,303
and what you already know,

132
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,120
could you ever imagine
using genetic engineering

133
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,823
to change your unborn child?
