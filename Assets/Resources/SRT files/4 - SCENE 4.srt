1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,190
- In this form,

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,980
I know it's not a child yet,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,540
in the sense it does not
smile at the sight of a parent

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,520
or a little wind.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,333
It cannot wrap its whole hand
around one's little finger,

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,073
and it cannot stare into its eyes and see.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,890
But it has all the potential

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,070
to be smaller than a millimetre.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,670
Yet it has all the
instructions it needs to grow

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,833
and become the life we desire.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,853
This does not.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,653
No, you do not need to say.

13
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,810
This knowledge has come
about because of this scan?

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,250
- It has.

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,530
- Could we have found this another way?

16
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,363
- Possibly.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,353
But there would likely be
no hope in that knowledge,

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,783
only pain.

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,140
- For all this knowledge,

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,090
it's still a fact

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,090
that not all pregnancies go
the way one expects or wants.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,930
And how unbelievable joy can
turn to unbelievable sadness,

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
for it has always been the case

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,990
that some life will shine and fade

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,560
without anyone knowing they ever existed.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,770
Some life will fade out of choice,

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,690
others against the will
of expecting parents,

28
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,213
nearly always without fault or blame.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,900
It's as painful an experience

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,900
as one could imagine at life
not lived ended far too soon.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,010
A pain many of us have shared.

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,200
A pain there's been very
little we could do to prevent

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,173
and know what we might do to change that.

34
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,880
- I know the pain you talk of.

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,423
And coming through it,

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,913
I know that was a path I
and they had to travel.

37
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,330
- Given the choice,

38
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,173
would you have wanted to
try and save their life?

39
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,573
- I think at the time,

40
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,213
I would've done anything
to hold him in my arms.

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,293
But,

42
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,020
I've come to terms with the fact

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,020
that it was a life that
was not meant to be.

44
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,243
However much I wanted it to live,

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,003
its path was not that.

46
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,793
And with time,

47
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,970
I've learned to accept the fact

48
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,013
that that's just a part of life.

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,080
- But with genetic engineering,

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,510
there may have been
something we could have done.

51
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,533
- But still.

52
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,240
I'm not sure I could have gone that far.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,420
- Think of it like life-saving surgery.

54
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,180
You would not deny a
child that, would you?

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,330
- But I don't think those
two things are the same.

56
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,203
- No, not exactly, but
both are interventions.

57
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,010
Say instead of a metal scalpel

58
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,310
and a special patch to
repair a hole in one's heart,

59
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,080
coded RNA seeks and replaces
errors in our genetic code

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,040
to intervene before a
hole could even form.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,400
It cannot save every life,
but for those that it can...

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,470
- It's not as if you're
correcting something

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,990
that you hold in your hands.

64
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,890
You're changing what that
child was meant to be,

65
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,890
and altering that feels like...

66
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,950
- Like we are altering their destiny.

67
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,680
- Like all interventions do.

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
Remember, we are simply
tweaking their code

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,020
to ensure they have a chance of life.

70
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,280
We are changing nothing
that can't already exist.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,100
- I don't believe that to be true.

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,720
I think instinctively,

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,520
you might want to do everything you could,

74
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,633
but it might not be one simple
intervention that does it.

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,073
You might end up changing
the child in so many ways.

76
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,220
It brings into question at what point

77
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,320
it's still the child you conceived.

78
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,360
- What wrong could be done to a life

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,900
if its alternative is no life at all?

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,073
- It's not that.

81
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,278
It's not a straightforward a question

82
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,903
as you make it out to be.

83
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,623
And I just wonder.

84
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,370
Is that a fair ask

85
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,110
of a parent for a child
that was not destined to be?

86
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,720
- When it might be the
only thing we could do

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,030
to save their life,

88
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,290
I don't think we have
a choice except to ask.

89
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,440
- Nothing would stop
me from saying, "Yes."

90
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,560
- Could there be

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,443
a more delicate question than this?

92
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,610
Although we refer to
this as an unborn child,

93
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,593
it is both a child, not a child,

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,200
and an intervention in
such a natural process,

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,830
however painful, is...

96
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,610
Please if you can, I'd like to know

97
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,270
if you would be willing
to use genetic engineering

98
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,630
to attempt to save your unborn child

99
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,203
if it was the only option.

100
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:24,840
Even if that meant
changing the very nature

101
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,153
of what that child was meant to be.
