1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,160
- Welcome.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,860
And thank you for joining us today.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,860
Choosing Children is a live,
interactive experience.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,570
Your role will be passive,

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,570
not insignificant, but passive.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,823
So please remain silent throughout.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,780
Do not get up from your
chair until the end,

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,020
unless you need to leave the experience.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,923
And please ensure all
mobiles are switched off.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,260
Through the experience,

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,900
you will be asked a series of questions,

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,240
which I will repeat to you.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,243
Answer these by clicking on
the device in front of you.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,050
The questions will be testing,

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,710
and if you do not feel capable
of attempting to answer them,

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,720
or if it becomes too much,

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,000
you are absolutely free to leave

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,010
the way you came in.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,520
But remember, you would not be here

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,963
if you could not help.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,500
This is a safe space

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,780
for us to unravel the difficult questions

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,640
you are to hear together.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,833
We are in uncharted territory,

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,723
and as yet there is no right or wrong.

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,053
Not yet.

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,320
No one will know the answers you give,

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,060
but your answer will be linked

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,640
to what happens in the space.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,443
So consider them and answer
as honestly as you can.

31
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,160
Now, check those phones
are off one more time

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,800
and say those words that
cannot wait until after

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,303
to those that you came with.

34
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,053
Ready?

35
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,552
Okay.

36
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,383
Let's begin.
