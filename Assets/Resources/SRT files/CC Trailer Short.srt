1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:01,490
(soft music)

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,440
- I have a problem.

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,180
You see,

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,820
in a time before memory existed

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,307
out of nothing,

6
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:10,290
(exploding sound)

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,010
a universe was created.

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,200
So big.

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,271
So massive.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,573
It's impossible to comprehend
in any meaningful way.

11
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:22,330
And in one small corner

12
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,984
of that

13
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:24,913
vast,

14
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:25,746
vast universe

15
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,762
through pure chance

16
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,913
and the great infiniteness of time,

17
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:33,360
a proliferation of life emerged.

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,527
Life that would eventually become us.

19
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,780
For most of our existence

20
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,640
we knew little of the details of exactly

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,090
how we were created.

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,550
Until one day, our knowledge

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,150
our technologies allowed us to
discover the building blocks

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,250
for life itself.

25
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,040
And in the blink of an eye

26
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,913
we went from mapping our
creation to editing it.

27
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,170
Giving us the power to
not only create life

28
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,333
but to control it.

29
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,860
Making us the gods

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,890
of our

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,630
and others

32
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,363
destiny

33
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,070
and the moral dilemmas

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,860
that arise from this

35
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,713
may be the biggest
humanity has ever faced.

36
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,220
So today

37
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,743
I ask you

38
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,550
what role genetic engineering should play

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,133
in the development of our unborn children.

40
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,484
