1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,660
- I just wonder,

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,030
does this differ from the right

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,663
to edit out a perceived impairment?

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,113
I mean...

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,980
If we want to deny someone the
right to put an impairment,

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,083
a perceived impairment, into their child,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,673
is it right for us to take one out?
